    Hello Everyone, My name is Daniel Thibeault

    I came here to NEIT to learn game design. 
    This has been a dream of mine for a long time.
    I was an aircraft mechnic in the Airforce for 8 years before starting here.
    I have a fulltime job at night at Electric Boat in CT to support my family.
